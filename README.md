## Summary: 
This app is used to fetch weather information from the openweathermap.org API and display said information on the home page. The app uses the "One Call API" and the "5 Day/ 3 Hour Forecast" APIs to gather the data needed. The dashboard also uses the local storage to store previous searches and display them for later calls.
